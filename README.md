## Contributions

Much of this project was built over Christmas break, but there were a few things that weren't working quite properly. I started over today and pieced it all together slowly again to help me debug and submit it.

My instructor helped me figure out why my links weren't working. I realized that GitHub doesn't like capital letters in file structures.

I was having so much fun with this project that I decided to also add a few features, like:

* Displaying high scores
* Instant feedback on right/wrong answers
* A working restart button
* A clear high score button
* Time deduction notifications

I used a web app called "WebFlow" to help me understand how to write the CSS styling so the page looked more modern. WebFlow allows me to place elements on a blank webpage, style them as I prefer, and then shows me the underlying code for that styling. It's an incredibly useful tool!

This has been my favorite challenge yet!
