Much of this was built over Christmas break but there were a few things that werent working quite properly. I started over today and pieced it all together slowly again to help me debug it and submit. 

My instructor helped me figure out why my links werent working. I guess  github doesnt like capital letters in files structures.

I was having so much fun with this project that I decided to also add a few ideas like:
 * displaying high score
 * instant feedback on right/wrong answers
 * a working restart button
 * clear high score button
 * time deduction notifications
 
 I used a web app called "WebFlow" to help me understand how to write the css styling so the page looked more modern. The app lets me place elements on a blank webpage and style them how I like with an intuitive GUI, then lets me read the code used to replicate that styling! Heck yeah!
 
 This was my favorite challenge yet!
