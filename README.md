## contributions

Much of this was built over Christmas break but there were a few things that werent working quite properly. I started over basically today and pieced it all together slowly again to help me debug it and submit. I also added a few ideas like displaying high score, instant feedback on right/wrong answers, and a working restart button. I used a web app called "WebFlow" to help me understand how to write the css styling so the page looked more modern. My favorite challenge yet!
